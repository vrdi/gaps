# Some basic mathematical questions to get us started

## A few of these questions may admit a closed-form mathematical answer, but don't be shy to use simulation.

1. Given a random sample of N numbers between 0 and 1, what is the probability that none of these numbers lies in a chosen interval of width W? Plot this as a function of X for high N.

2. Given a random sample of N numbers which sum to 1, sorted from smallest to largest, what is the expected value of the biggest gap between consecutive numbers?

3. Find the distribution for the largest gap in a random sample of N numbers which sum to 1, sorted from smallest to largest. 

4. Find the distribution of ALL gaps in a random sample of N numbers which sum to 1, sorted from smallest to largest.

5. Given an interval [L,K] in [0,1], what is the probability that a random sample of N numbers which sum to 1 avoids this interval? This is a very hard question. A reasonable test case for us will be N = 33, and the interval [0.37/8,0.55/8].
